# Agent Based Simulation 
<b>Agent based simulation of vehicles carrying building material</b>

## Mission <img src="https://github.com/Atenna/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/blob/master/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/GUI/images/l_car_D.png" width="80">

The main goal of this project is to identify the most efficient solution for a company providing vehicles carrying building material. 

## What is implemented <img src="https://github.com/Atenna/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/blob/master/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/GUI/images/p_Nakladac_B.png" width="80"> 

* Vehicles are able to get from the Depo to the Material Loaders
* There are Agents for Transport, Depo, Stock, Model and Environment
* Agents are able to communicate using customized messages
* Custom setting of uset vehicles in a simulation run
* Basic graphical user interface for basic usage

## What needs to be implemented <img src="https://github.com/Atenna/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/blob/master/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/ds-agent-oriented-simulation/GUI/images/l_Vykladac_A.png" width="80"> 

* Functional statistics of vehicle occupancy, rate of failures
* Create a strategy for  replacing cars from queues during non-work hours
* Analyze and implement generators for material import to the Depo and export from the Stock
* Implement another interesting parts of user interface
